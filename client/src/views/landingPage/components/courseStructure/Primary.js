          <h2>What We Offer</h2>
          <p>
            Primary school children have a high ability to learn English because
            of their social tendency, curiosity and natural enthusiasm. They
            tend to work very actively and tend quickly if they are sitting for
            long periods without activity. Therefore, physical movement,
            gestures and activities are important parts of the learning process
            for this group.
          </p>
          <p>
            We use a good balance between motor and quiet activities to help
            keep these energetic minds awake and excited. Primary school
            children also interact well with imagination, so story-reading is a
            good way to improve or increase their ability to learn.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since good pronunciation and confidence are key features of learning
            English at an early age, we optimize the use of rhyming songs,
            poems, repetitve exercises, and activities that focus on individual
            sounds or divergent sounds and help to highligh the strengths and
            rhythm of English.
          </p>
